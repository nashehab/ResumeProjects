Description of Program: This program will create graph using a list of edges and vertices, and implement a topological DFS sort. The last line of the list of edges is commented out, because including this line will create a cycle. I have screenshots of this both included and not included, to show what the output would be with and without a cycle present. The output will explicitly state that there is a cylce present, and which edge creates the cycle. Without a cycle, the output will correctly display the list of vertices ordered from the graph.
